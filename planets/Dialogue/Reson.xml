			<Page>You are standing in the newly-created <![CDATA[<color=orange>Banjo Galaxy</color>]]>.</Page>
			<Page>At least, I think you are. My tracking technology doesn't seem to be working here.</Page>
			<Page>This place was created by my cohorts and I using the magic banjo. However, I did not anticipate that plucking the strings would cost my friends their lives.</Page>
			<Page>In this universe, playing god will always cost you.</Page>

			<Page>My name is <![CDATA[<color=orange>Reson</color>]]>. I am a member of an advanced species known as the Nomai. I am an explorer, just like you.</Page>
			<Page>My guild and I were exploring a solar system not too far from your own when we discovered the banjo.</Page>
			<Page>The planet had been stripped of its resources. Also, a great storm had covered the planet in ice.</Page>
			<Page>But, somehow, there sat the banjo. Peacefully lying in a shed. Unscathed.</Page>
			<Page>Like someone had just used it.</Page>
			<Page>After studying it at our camp, Fret determined that it had the power to solve the problem that no Nomai could: avoiding the <![CDATA[<color=orange>End of the Universe</color>]]>.</Page>
			<Page>Fret thought it was too dangerous to use. Rim, Bridge, and I disagreed. If there was a chance to save our species, why not take it?</Page>

			<Page>The magic banjo is very powerful, and I regret not taking the time to study it further.</Page>
			<Page>When we studied it at our camp, we determined that it has <![CDATA[<color=orange>space-altering properties</color>]]>.</Page>
			<Page>A few chords played on the banjo are enough to create entire galaxies. We are standing in the result of a simple G chord.</Page>
			<Page>I wanted to play it more once I arrived on this world, but the banjo disappeared as I stepped through the singularity.</Page>
			<Page>I'm not too concerned, though. I have a feeling it is <![CDATA[<color=orange>close by</color>]]>.</Page>

			<Page>I am not sure. The skies above us are cloudy, and I did not bring the proper equipment to travel off-world.</Page>
			<Page>Interestingly, it looks like a <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hearthian vessel</color>]]> appeared here moments before you did.</Page>
			<Page>It seems that fate has chosen you to be the first to see what's beyond the fog.</Page>
